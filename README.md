# CS-255: System Analysis and Design

# DriverPass System Analysis & Design Project

This repository contains my final submission for CS-255: System Analysis & Design. The artifacts are a complete Business Requirements Document and a Software Design Document for DriverPass, a cloud-based scheduling and management platform designed for a DMV test prep company. This project involved defining user roles, understanding user needs, and developing a scalable web application from a user-centered standpoint that will replace manual spreadsheets and manual scheduling. Together, the submitted documents represent my ability to develop, organize, and convey workable software solutions that meet operational specifications and technical requirements.

## Reflection

One of my strengths in this project was how clearly I articulated the user roles and needs during the business requirements stage. I broke the functionality down by how each user role interacts with the system: student, secretary, administrator, and manager. My structure helped me stay focused in the design phase and ensured that I did not forget about the experience behind the technology. Once I had a clear picture of the user needs, I was able to convert those into functional and non-functional requirements. I believe this clarity helped me lay a solid platform for the rest of the project. I approached the requirements like blueprints for a working system that a real-world business could implement.

In hindsight, my diagrams couldâ€™ve been cleaner and easier to read. Even though I addressed the technical requirements, better spacing, clearer labeling, and adding something like a color key to my Gantt chart would have improved readability. Some of my UML diagrams and flowcharts felt a bit messy at times.

Additionally, I think I was naively superficial in the section Assumptions and Limitations. Listing assumptions on access to the system, rollout approach, deployment to different geographical locations, and what operational support might look like would have real implications during the later parts of the project.

During this project, I constantly worked to remain focused on the frustrations that users actually face. I developed features, such as real-time scheduling, automated notifications, and defined user roles, to address specific scenarios users can encounterâ€”rescheduling lessons, keeping track of instructor schedules, or something more obscure, like double-booked lessons and forgotten passwords. While itâ€™s important to resolve edge cases, I also believe that doing so helps people feel more comfortable with the online environment.

This project affirmed to me that good software design starts with studying real people in their real daily lives. I learned again the importance of thoughtful, clear, and meaningful documentation and visual aids when providing clarity to non-technical stakeholders about some of the technical aspects of software development.

I want to ensure that I iterate on designs earlier than I have typically done, that I avoid making assumptions too late, and that I keep developing my diagramming abilities to enhance communication. These steps help provide a solid foundation for development and collaboration at the same time. Having a structured way of working makes it considerably easier to produce software for clients that achieves its intended results.

In future projects, I will iteratively develop my diagrams early and get feedback sooner, especially to validate the visuals I share with stakeholders. Iâ€™ll also spend more time identifying assumptions that can affect rollout and user adoption. My approach to software design will continue to start with real people and real problems, and Iâ€™ll keep working on how clearly I communicate both the logic and the visuals of a system.
